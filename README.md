# InventoryApp
This Inventory app helps to keep a track of all inventory using simple local database and it implements all CRUD commands it implements database in an effective manner using ContentProviders and CursonAdapter.
This app is generally used for learning database in Android Development.


Inventory app was just my attempt to understand the basic concepts Database functionality in Android and the basics of CRUD commands.

While working on the app i learnt concepts like

1. How to create database in Android.
2. How to use Content Providers to manage databases.
3. How to use Cursor Loaders to fetch data from the database.
4. To fire camera intent and take photo and store the photo in database.
5. Create, Read,Update and Delete command implementation.

All implementation is done in Android Studio.

Learning these concepts were important for me to understand the database basis during my Android Development.
This project was listed in the Udacity's Android Basics but since I was watching free videos i just used the project rubric to develop this App.
